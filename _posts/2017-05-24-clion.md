I had to try it after so many people have been talking good stuff about CLion for `c++` development.

I do all my stuff with Vim, and since last year with [Neovim](https://neoVim.io/), including writing this blog post in markdown.
I love the idea of Linux as an IDE, and I have practicing it for a while. My setup consists on a a little bit convoluted [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/phcerdan/configuration_files/tree/master/dot_files), and `tmux`. So basically I do it everything in the terminal.

Of course, Vim is an editor, not an IDE, but there are a few plugins that help a lot with IDE-like features: [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for autocompletion, and [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) for generating code snippets, really really good for LaTeX, CMake, and verbose languages in general.
A game changer in favor of neoVim instead of Vim is the fuzzy finder [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim). It is useful for bash/zsh but also using it inside the inline `:term` of neoVim.
In times of need, where I am learning a new library, such as [ITK](https://github.com/phcerdan/ITKIsotropicWavelets/), or [DGtal](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/) for work, I miss the navigation of source files that IDE provides, in those cases I use another plugin called `eclim` that creates a server running the eclipse IDE in the background. The problem with this is that you have to create a project in Eclipse CDT, setting appropriate flags for the indexer to work properly, etc. The good thing is that you have to do it once, and then run `eclimd` for starting the headless server, and send queries to it from Neovim.

YouCompleteMe has a Checker/Validator based on `libclang`, it works great with the help of `cmake` to generate the `compilation database` in simple projects, but forget about it in heavy or convoluted templated source files, and it doesn't work in headers. It is a `libclang` limitation, `YCM` is great, but not really its job.

I have never been against using IDE's, but I like being proficient in Vim/Neovim for working with a variety of languages in the same environment. I can script a figure in Python, write a manuscript in LaTeX, markdown, or `c++`, using the same editor and pretty similar workflow. Vim plugins to the rescue for every case, but all of them sharing 99% of the same functionalities.
For scripting languages I am very fond of `tmux` and `Slime` plugin to send text from Vim directly to a tmux pane where `ipython` or `R` interpreters are running.

Still, I am missing easy access to documentation, type checkers (`YCM` has one though), refactor, and specially navigating through hierarchies, check where a specific function is called, etc. I only need it for `c++` though, and not always. Ah, almost forget I use [`ConqueGDB`](https://github.com/phcerdan/Conque-GDB) for integrating a GDB console into vim, and works nicely.

Anyway, I am going to try CLion with the IdeaVim plugin (basic Vim emulation), and share my experiences.

EDIT:
2 days later...

Ok, I am out, I am missing `tmux`, git in the shell, executing and tweaking stuff in the console, my own shortcuts, I guess I have become linux/vim-dependent! I will wait for [`clangd`](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra/tree/master/clangd), and implementation of the Microsoft [Language Server Protocol](https://eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/april/article5.php) using the `clang` compiler.
They are [now](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2017-May/053951.html) implementing the construction of the index/database, and then, ready to get it into `neovim`, see [issue #5522](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/5522), and the plugin [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) to communicate with LSP servers.
